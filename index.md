## **About Me**
### *I am a 22-year-old student studying Mathematics-Computer Science at the University of California, San Diego. I see programming as a tool to solve different kinds of problems we have in real life, an extension of humans that provides the ability to do complex math and algorithm, a magic that makes imaginations become reality, an entertainment I can play in my spare time.*
